// NULLDiagnostic is the text used for a null value in a diagnostic rendering. It is
// exported so callers that parse this output (logs, assertions) can name it.
const NULLDiagnostic = "NULL"

// diagnosticValue renders one value for the String() (diagnostic) form of a container -
// an array element, a struct field, a record column.
//
// A null renders as the bare marker NULL. A non-null value whose own rendering is
// identical to that marker is quoted, so `array(NULL)` (a null element) and
// `array('NULL')` (a string whose text happens to be "NULL") are not the same text -
// the two used to be indistinguishable, which is exactly the confusion that makes a
// NULL-handling bug look like working code. Only colliding values are quoted: every
// other rendering, including the existing expectations for strings such as
// `struct<x:11,y:hello,...>`, is unchanged. SQL text goes through Sql(), which quotes
// consistently and is the right thing to compare against when a value must round-trip.
